## Access the Application

### Option 1: Port Forwarding (Easiest)

```bash
./scripts/port-forward.sh
```

**Open in browser:**
- **Store:** http://localhost:8080
- **Admin Dashboard:** http://localhost:8080/secret-admin-dashboard-xyz

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop.

---

### Option 2: Ngrok (Public URLs)

```bash
./scripts/ngrok-start.sh
```

Get public HTTPS URLs for all services!

---

### Option 3: Telepresence (Development)

```bash
./scripts/telepresence-start.sh
```

Debug locally while connected to the cluster!

**Then run local services:**
```bash
# In separate terminals:
npm run start:backend    # If intercepting backend
npm run start:payment    # If intercepting payment service
```
